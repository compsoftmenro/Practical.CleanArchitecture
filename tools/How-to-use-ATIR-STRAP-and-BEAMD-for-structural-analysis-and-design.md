## Modeling with ATIR STRAP
 
ATIR STRAP allows you to create a 3D model of your structure using various types of elements such as beams, columns, walls, slabs, cables, springs, hinges, gaps, etc. You can also import your model from CAD or BIM software using AutoSTRAP, which automatically converts your drawings or models to STRAP elements. You can define the material properties, cross-sections, supports, loads, load combinations, and design parameters for your model using the intuitive user interface. STRAP supports multiple languages such as English, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, and Taiwan.
 
## Analysis with ATIR STRAP
 
ATIR STRAP performs fast and accurate analysis of your structure using advanced solvers that have been tested by industry professionals for more than 35 years. You can choose from different types of analysis such as static linear, modal, response spectrum, time history, P-Delta, slab deflection, bridge staged construction, etc. You can also perform nonlinear analysis for cables and hinges. STRAP provides graphical and tabular output of the analysis results such as displacements, forces, moments, stresses, reactions, etc.
 
## Design with ATIR BEAMD
 
ATIR BEAMD is integrated with ATIR STRAP and allows you to design and detail concrete and steel members according to various national design codes. You can design reinforced concrete beams, columns, walls, slabs, and footings; prestressed concrete beams and slabs; hot-rolled or cold-formed steel beams and columns; composite steel-concrete beams and columns; etc. You can also perform optimization of steel sections based on analysis results or sway control. BEAMD provides graphical and tabular output of the design results such as reinforcement details, section properties, code checks, etc.
 
## Drawing production with ATIR BEAMD
 
ATIR BEAMD also allows you to produce drawings of your structure based on the analysis and design results. You can generate plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules, etc. using the built-in drawing editor or export them to DXF format for further editing in CAD software. You can customize the drawing settings such as scale, dimensioning style, annotation style, layering system etc. according to your preferences.
 
## Conclusion
 
ATIR STRAP and BEAMD are comprehensive and sophisticated software for structural analysis and design of concrete and steel structures. They offer a complete solution for structural engineers who want to achieve reliable and economical design of their projects.
